							<p>
								<strong>Thank you for downloading World to Build!</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								In an effort to protect World to Build (the &quot;<strong>Game</strong>&quot;) and the players within our community, we have this end user license agreement in order to set our some rules for downloading and using our Game.
								This license is a legal agreement between you and us (Happy Ninja Games, LLC.) and will describe the terms and conditions of using our Game. We do not like reading documents like this any more than you do, so we have made an effort to keep this license as short as possible.
								If you break this agreement, we may stop you from using our Game.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you download, use or play our Game, you agreeing to follow the rules of this end user license agreement (&quot;<strong>EULA</strong>&quot;). If you do not want to, or cannot agree to these rules, you must not download, use or play our Game. 
								This EULA incorporates the official <a href="https://www.worldtobuild.com/legal/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://www.worldtobuild.com/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for the Worldtobuild.com website. If you live within the United States, this EULA incorporates our <a href="https://www.worldtobuild.com/legal/terms" target="_blank">Arbitration Agreement</a> as outlined in our Terms of Service as well. By agreeing to this EULA, you also agree to all of the terms of the foregoing documents, so please read them carefully before you continue.
							</p>
							<h5 class="legal-title">Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h5>
							<p>
								<strong>For United States residents only:</strong> Please review our <a href="https://www.worldtobuild.com/legal/terms" target="_blank">binding arbitration agreement</a> and class action waiver that is part of this EULA. Under this agreement, we both agree to use a neutral arbitrator to decide any indicidual claims that may arise and this agree to waive our rights to bring individual claims in court for consideration by a judge or jury. We also agree that class action lawsuits and class-wide arbitrations are not allowed under the terms of the agreement.
							</p>
							<p>
								You and we agree to the <a href="https://www.worldtobuild.com/legal/terms" target="_blank">Arbitration Agreement</a>, so please read it.
							</p>
							<h5 class="legal-title">Rules</h5>
							<p>
								You must not distribute anything we have made unless we specifically agree to it in writing. By &quot;distribute anything we have made&quot, we specifically mean:
								<li class="policy-indent">
									give any copy or copies of our Game to anyone else;
								</li>
								<li class="policy-indent">
									make commercial use of anything we have made;
								</li>
								<li class="policy-indent">
									try to make money or profit from anything we have made; or
								</li>
								<li class="policy-indent">
									let other people get access to anything we have made in a way that is unfair or unreasonable;
								</li>
							</p>
							<p>
								unless we specifically agree to it in writing. In addition, &quot;the Game&quot; and &quot;what we have made&quot; includes, but is not limited to, the client or the server software of our Game and includes the
								client or the server software our Game includes. It also includes updates, patches, downloadable content, modifications parts of those things, or anything else we have made.
							</p>
							<p>
								Otherwise, we are pretty relaxed about what you do. We encourage you to do cool things with our Game, but please do not do things that we say you cannot.
							</p>
							<h5 class="legal-title">Use</h5>
							<p>
								You have been granted a license to the Game so that you can play it and use it, yourself, on your devices.
							</p>
							<p>
								Below, we also give you limited rights to do other things, but we have to draw a line somewhere or else people will go too far. If you wish to make something pertaining to anything we have made, we are humbles, but please make sure that it cannot be interpreted as being official and that it complies with this EULA and our brand and asset usage guidelines. Above all, please do not make commercial use of anything we have made.
							</p>
							<p>
								You may not modify our Game in any way. You also cannot distribute &quot;hacked&quot; or altered versions of our Game software or server software.
							</p>
							<p>
								Within reason, you are free to do whatever you want with screenshots or videos of the Game. By &quot;within reason&quot;, we mean that you cannot make any commercial use of the them or do things that are unfair or adversely affect our rights unless we have specifically said that it is okay in this EULA, allowed it through our Brand and Asset Usage guidelines within our Terms of Service, or provided for it in a specific agreement between you and us.
							</p>
							<p>
								Essentially, do not make commercial use out of anything we have made unless we have specifically given you permission to do so. If the law expressly allows it, such as under a fair use or fair dealing doctrine, that is okay too - but only to the extent of the law applicable to you says so.
							</p>
							<p>
								In order to maintain the integrity of the Game, we need all Game downloads and updates to come from an authorized source. It is also important for us that third-party services do not seem official, as we cannot guarantee their quality. It is part of the responsibility we have to our players.
							</p>
							<h5 class="legal-title">Ownership</h5>
							<p>
								Although we license you permission to install the Game on your device and play out Game, we are still the owners of it. We are also the owners of all of our brands and any content contained in the Game. Therefore, when you play or use our Game in accordance with this EULA, you are not being granted ownership of the Game itself. The only permissions you have in connection with the Game and your installation of it are the permissions set out in this EULA.
							</p>
							<h5 class="legal-title">Content</h5>
							<p>
								If you make content available on or through our Game, you agree to give us permission to use, copy, modify, adapt, distribute, and publicly display that content. This permission is irrevocable. You are not giving up your ownership rights in your content, you are just giving us permission to use it. For example, we may need to copy, reformat, and distribute content that you post on our website so others can read it. If you do not want to give us these permissions, do not make content available on or through our Game. Please think carefully before you make any content available, because it may be made public and may even be used by other people in a way you do not like.
							</p>
							<p>
								Content you make on our Game must abide by our Terms of Service. For example, you may not create any offensive material, including racist or adult content, while using the Game. Any content you make available on our Game must be your creation or you must have the legal right to use it. You must not and you agree that you will not make any content available, using the Game that infringes the rights of others.
							</p>
							<p>
								We reseve the right to remove or delete any content at our disrection.
							</p>
							<h5 class="legal-title">Updates</h5>
							<p>
								We may make upgrades, updates, and patches available from time to time, but we do not have to. We are also not obliged to provide ongoing support or maintenance of any Game. We hope to continue to release new updates for our Game, but we just cannot guarantee that we will do so. With updates come changes that may not work well with other software, like anti-virus programs. No, we do not offer viruses, but sometimes software may be mistakenly detected as one. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>OUR LIABILITY, GOVERNING LAW, AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								The terms of this EULA do not affect any legal statutory rights that you might have under the law that applies to you for the Game. You might have certain rights which the law that applies to you says cannot be excluded. Nothing we say in these terms will affect those legal rights, even if we say something which sounds like it contradicts your legal rights. That is what we mean whenever we say &quot;subject to applicable law&quot;.
							</p>
							<p>
								SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, when you get a copy of our Game, we provide it to you &quot;as is&quot;. Updates are also provided &quot;as is&quot;. This means that we are not making any promises to you about the standards or quality of the Game, or that our Game will be uninterrupted or error free. We are not responsible for any loss or damage that it may cause. You bear the entire risk as to its quality and performance. You have to accept that we may release games well before they are complete so they may (and often will) have bugs. If you would like to notify us about a potential bug, we have a feature for that on our website.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you or we ever have a dispute in court, which we hope that never happens, the exclusive forum will be a state or federal court in Wake County, North Carolina. The laws relative to your state govern this EULA and all disputes that arise, including disputes relating to them, our Game or website, regardless of conflict of laws principles, except that the Federal Arbitration Act governs everything related to arbitration.
							</p>
							<h5 class="legal-title">Termination</h5>
							<p>
								If we want, we can terminate this EULA if you breach any of the terms. You can terminate it to, ay any time; all you have to do is uninstall the Game from your device and the EULA will be terminated. If the EULA is terminated, you will no longer have any of the rights to the Game given in this license.
								The Arbitration Agreement (if you live in the United States) and the paragraphs about &quot;Ownership&quot;, &quot;Liability&quot; and &quot;General&quot; will continue to apply even after the EULA is terminated.
							</p>
							<h5 class="legal-title">General</h5>
							<p>
								Your local law may give you the rights that this EULA cannot change; if so, this EULA applies as far as the law allows. Nothing in this license limits our liability for death or bodily injury resulting from our negligence or fraudulent misrepresentations.
							</p>
							<p>
								We may change this EULA from time to time, if we have a reason to, such as changes to our games, practices, or legal obligations. Those changes will be effective only to the extent that they can legally apply. For example, if you use the Game only in single-player mode and do not use the updates we make available, the old EULA applies. But if you do use the updates or use parts of the game that reply on our providing ongoing online services, then they new EULA will apply. 
								In that case, we will inform you of the change before it takes effect, either by posting a notice on our website or by other reasonable means. We are not going to be unfair about this, but sometimes the law changes or someone does something that affects other users of the Game and we therefore need to mention it.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you decide to come to us with a suggestion for any of our websites, games, features, or any part of our services, that suggestion is made for free and we have no obligation to accept your suggestion or consider it. That means we can use (or not use) your suggestion in the way we want, and we do not necessarily have to pay you to use your suggestion. If you believe your suggestion is good enough to require payment for, please do not submit it to us unless you have first told us that you expect to be paid for it. Additionally, we have to respond to your request in writing, and you have to also submit said suggestion in writing. That does not mean we would never pay our players for valuable contributions to our Game, but it does mean that we have no obligation to pay for such suggestions.
